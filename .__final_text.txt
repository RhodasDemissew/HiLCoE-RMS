REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS DOCUMENT `n 1. Introduction `n The HiLCoE Research Management System (HiLCoE-RMS) is a role-based, web-based platform designed to manage the complete lifecycle of masterâ€™s research at the School of Computer Science and Technology. It replaces the current manual, email-based, and paper-dependent process with an automated workflow system that supports structured submissions, automated notifications, and institutional compliance checks. `n The current process relies heavily on physical documents, individual email exchanges, and in-person coordination, creating delays, repetitive administrative work, and difficulties in tracking progress or enforcing formatting and plagiarism guidelines. As a result, communication gaps occur, milestone deadlines are missed, and performance data remains scattered and inaccessible. `n HiLCoE-RMS digitizes the established research workflow without altering its sequence, enabling: `n Researchers follow a guided, deadline-driven submission process using standardized templates. `n Advisors to review, approve, or request modifications to submissions efficiently. `n Coordinators to track milestone completion, manage assignments, and perform automated precheck and plagiarism verification. `n This Requirements Analysis Document captures the functional and non-functional requirements, system models, and constraints identified through structured interviews with the research coordinator, analysis of institutional guidelines, and benchmarking against similar academic systems. It will serve as a living reference throughout design, development, and testing. `n 1.1 Purpose of the System `n The purpose of the HiLCoE Research Management System (HiLCoE-RMS) is to provide a role-based, automated platform that manages the complete research lifecycle for masterâ€™s research at the School of Computer Science and Technology. The system aims to reduce manual workload, improve process consistency, and ensure compliance with institutional research guidelines. `n The HiLCoE-RMS will: `n Automate repetitive coordinator tasks such as scheduling, notifications, template distribution, and document precheck. `n Guide Researchers through each milestone in the research process using standardized templates, clear deadlines, and automated reminders. `n Enable advisors to review submissions, provide feedback, and approve work efficiently. `n Support coordinators with real-time progress tracking, milestone status dashboards, and AI-assisted plagiarism and formatting verification. `n Generate automated reports on milestone completion rates, plagiarism statistics, engagement levels, and research trends for administrative decision-making. `n Maintain a secure repository for all research-related documents, templates, and evaluation forms. `n By automating the established workflow without altering its academic structure, HiLCoE-RMS ensures that all stakeholders; researchers, advisors, and coordinators  can perform their roles more efficiently while improving transparency, accountability, and academic integrity.1.2 Scope of the System `n The HiLCoE Research Management System (HiLCoE-RMS) will automate the management of the entire research lifecycle, from registration to final journal article submission, in accordance with HiLCoEâ€™s academic structure. The system will retain the existing process sequence but replace manual, email-based coordination with automated workflows, real-time tracking, and role-based user interfaces. `n In-Scope Functionalities `n User Role Management â€“ Role-based dashboards and permissions for researchers, advisors, coordinators, and administrators. `n Automated Submission &amp; Review Workflow â€“ Step-by-step submission process for synopsis, proposal, progress reports, thesis, defense scheduling, grading, and journal article. `n Advisor Assignment â€“ Assign advisors to researchers with a maximum limit of 10 Researchers per advisor. `n Automated Notifications â€“ Deadline reminders, feedback alerts, defense schedules, and milestone updates. `n Document Management â€“ Storage and retrieval of research documents, templates, and guidelines. `n Progress Tracking â€“ Visual dashboards to monitor milestone status for each Researcher. `n Automated Precheck &amp; Verification â€“ Formatting compliance checks and plagiarism detection integration. `n Extension Requests â€“ Submission and approval workflow for deadline extensions. `n Reports &amp; Analytics â€“ Automated generation of performance metrics, plagiarism summaries, engagement analytics, and milestone completion statistics. `n Out-of-Scope Functionalities `n Research funding and budget management. `n Mobile application version (web-only platform). `n Fully automated plagiarism enforcement without human review. `n Integration with external institutions or multi-department deployment. `n 1.3 Limitations `n While the HiLCoE-RMS is being designed with careful attention to quality assurance, performance, and usability, certain constraints are unavoidable in the initial release.We have incorporated measures such as stakeholder-driven requirement elicitation, iterative validation with the coordinator, and alignment with institutional research policies to ensure a reliable and effective system. However, due to the realities of available time, budget, and institutional context, the following limitations will apply: `n AI Scope: While AI/NLP-assisted verification will help detect plagiarism and formatting issues, it may not identify all forms of academic misconduct; manual review will remain necessary for complex cases. `n Institution-Specific Design: The system will be tailored to HiLCoEâ€™s specific research process and will require modifications to be used by other institutions or departments. `n Testing Scope: User testing will be limited to a pilot group of Researchers, advisors, and coordinators, which may not expose all edge cases or usability challenges before deployment. `n Platform Access: The system will be available only via modern web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) and will not include a dedicated mobile application. `n Security Level: Security measures will be suitable for academic environments but will not meet enterprise-level security standards. `n Manual Data Entry: Initial system setup, including population of user profiles and historical research records, will require manual entry. `n Resource Constraints: Budget and time limitations may restrict integration with advanced third-party tools or high-cost automation services. `n 2. Current System `n The current research management process at HiLCoE is carried out manually and relies heavily on email communication between researchers, advisors, and the coordinator. Each stage of the research lifecycle from registration to final journal article submission is handled as a separate, disconnected task, with no automated workflow to track progress or ensure compliance with deadlines and guidelines. `n While this approach follows a well-defined institutional sequence, it introduces significant administrative overhead, creates communication gaps, and makes it difficult to monitor progress effectively. Document templates and guidelines are distributed via email, milestone tracking is maintained manually, and repetitive checks such as formatting compliance are performed individually for each submission. `n 2.1 Workflow Overview `n The process currently follows these steps: `n Registration â€“ Researchers register for research activities. `n Orientation â€“ Briefing on research requirements, timelines, and guidelines. `n Profiling â€“ Researchers provide contact details (email, phone). Email is the primary communication method. `n Synopsis Scheduling &amp; Submission â€“ Coordinator schedules submission date; Researchers submit via email; coordinator provides feedback (Accept / Modify / Reject). `n Advisor Assignment â€“ Coordinator assigns advisors (max 10 Researchers per advisor) and sends notifications via email. `n Proposal Submission â€“ Researchers submit to advisor; after approval, forwarded to coordinator. `n Progress Report 1 Submission â€“ Sent to coordinator (copy to advisor). `n Progress Report 2 Submission â€“ Sent three months after Progress Report 1. `n Thesis Report Submission â€“ Submitted before final draft; given to coordinator (and optionally advisor) as readiness signal for evaluation. `n Formatting Precheck â€“ Coordinator manually checks font, margins, and formatting compliance. `n Examiner Assignment â€“ Coordinator assigns examiner and provides evaluation form. `n Defense Scheduling â€“ Examiner reviews research for 10 days; defense details are emailed to all parties. `n Grade Submission â€“ Examiner â†’ Coordinator â†’ Registrar; final document submitted before and after defense (with corrections if needed). `n Journal Article Submission â€“ Final condensed article (8â€“15 pages) submitted post-defense. `n Alternate Flow: `n Researchers who cannot meet deadlines submit an extension request form via email to the coordinator for approval. `n Document Templates: `n Templates for synopsis, proposal, progress reports, thesis, final draft, and journal article exist but are distributed manually via email. `n  `n  `n  `n 2.2 Challenges in the Current System `n From coordinator feedback and observation, the main challenges are: `n Communication Delays: Dependence on email makes it difficult to ensure timely responses and updates. `n Manual Tracking: Deadlines, submissions, and progress are monitored manually, increasing the risk of oversight. `n Repetitive Work: Formatting checks and template distribution are repeated for each Researcher. `n Lack of Plagiarism Detection: No integrated originality verification, requiring separate manual checks. `n Data Fragmentation: Research-related data and documents are scattered across multiple email threads and personal storage. `n 2.3 Business rule `n 1. Account Activation  `n Only verified researchers and advisors can activate accounts. `n 2. Advisor Assignment `n  A researcher must be assigned exactly one advisor before submitting a proposal. `n Advisors can supervise a maximum of 10 researchers per semester. `n 3. Proposal Submission `n The proposal must be approved by the assigned advisor before it is reviewed by the  coordinator.  `n 4. Thesis Submission `n Plagiarism check must return a score below threshold before submission. `n 5. Document Templates `n All submissions must adhere to the structure defined in their respective template documents. `n 6. Document submission `n  Submissions are only permitted during the designated submission period. `n  `n 3. Proposed System `n The proposed HiLCoE Research Management System (HiLCoE-RMS) is designed as a role-based, automated workflow platform to address the challenges identified in the current research management process.By leveraging automation, real-time tracking, and built-in verification tools, the system will replace the manual, email-dependent workflow with a streamlined process that preserves the existing academic structure while improving efficiency and transparency. `n The systemâ€™s design is based on the findings from stakeholder interviews, institutional research policies, and benchmarking with similar academic systems. It prioritizes: `n Reducing repetitive tasks for the coordinator. `n Improving communication between Researchers, advisors, and coordinators. `n Ensuring timely feedback and milestone completion. `n Enforcing compliance with templates, formatting standards, and plagiarism guidelines. `n Providing institutional analytics for better decision-making. `n  `n 3.1 Overview `n The HiLCoE-RMS will guide Researchers, advisors, and coordinators through each stage of the research lifecycle while automating routine tasks and reducing administrative overhead. `n Key improvements include: `n Automated workflows for all research milestones; from registration to journal article submission. `n Role-specific dashboards for Researchers, advisors, coordinators, and administrators. `n Integrated submission and review process with built-in feedback statuses (Accept / Modify / Reject). `n Automatic notifications for deadlines, approvals, and defense schedules. `n Document repository for storing templates, submissions, and evaluation forms. `n AI/NLP-assisted verification for plagiarism detection and formatting compliance. `n Analytics and reporting on milestone completion, engagement levels, and plagiarism statistics. `n Request management for extensions, approvals, and scheduling changes. `n By automating repetitive tasks and providing real-time tracking, the HiLCoE-RMS will ensure more efficient research management, reduce delays, and improve transparency between all stakeholders. `n  `n 3.2 Actor Identification `n  `n Actor Name `n Role `n Description `n Researcher `n End User `n Graduate Researcher eligible and registered for the course. `n Advisor `n End User `n Faculty members who are assigned to supervise Researchers. `n Coordinator `n Admin `n Faculty member who oversees RMS operation. `n Examiner `n End User `n Expert who evaluates the research. `n  `n  `n 3.3 Functional Requirements `n The functional requirements define what the HiLCoE-RMS will do to meet the needs identified during the requirement elicitation phase.

Database Schema `n 4.1 Introduction `n The database schema of the HiLCoE Research Management System (HiLCoE-RMS) was designed by analyzing the systemâ€™s actors, functional requirements (FRs), business rules, use case scenarios, and object models. `n From the Actor Identification, we extracted entities for Researchers, Advisors, Coordinators, Examiners, and Administrators. `n From the Functional Requirements (FR1â€“FR21), we identified the need for core lifecycle tables (Projects, Submissions, Feedback, Grades, Defenses, Notifications, Extensions, etc.). `n From the Business Rules, we incorporated constraints such as advisor capacity (â‰¤10 active researchers), submission deadlines, plagiarism thresholds, and defense scheduling windows. `n From the Use Case and Sequence Models, we ensured coverage of workflows like project registration, document submission, advisor and coordinator review, examiner assignment, defense scheduling, grading, and automated notifications. `n The schema supports end-to-end management of the research process, enforces academic policies, and enables auditability for accountability. `n 4.2 Main Entities and Attributes `n A) Access Control `n Roles Stores role definitions: Researcher, Advisor, Coordinator, Examiner, and Administrator. Attributes: role_id, role_name. `n Users Central repository of login and identity information for all actors. Attributes: user_id, full_name, email, password_hash, role_id, status, created_at. Relationship: each User is assigned one Role; each User may extend into a Researcher, Advisor, Coordinator, or Examiner profile. `n B) Actor Profiles `n Researchers Profile details for students, linked 1:1 with Users. Attributes: researcher_id, program, phone, registered_at. `n Advisors Faculty profiles, with supervision capacity constraint. Attributes: advisor_id, department, max_capacity. `n Coordinators Administrative staff responsible for oversight. Attributes: coordinator_id. `n Examiners Faculty/experts responsible for grading. Attributes: examiner_id, specialization. `n C) Research Projects and Templates `n ResearchProjects Represents the research work of a student under an advisor. Attributes: project_id, researcher_id, advisor_id, title, status, created_at. Relationships: one Researcher may have one or more Projects; one Advisor supervises multiple Projects. `n DocumentTemplates Stores official templates (synopsis, proposal, progress reports, thesis, final draft, corrections, journal article). Attributes: template_id, type, version, file_path, is_active. Relationships: Submissions must reference a valid template. `n D) Submissions, Reviews, and Grades `n Submissions Records uploaded documents for each milestone. Attributes: submission_id, project_id, type, template_id, file_path, format_ok, plagiarism_score, status, submitted_at, reviewed_at. Relationship: each Submission belongs to one Project and uses one DocumentTemplate. `n Feedback Captures advisor and coordinator review comments. Attributes: feedback_id, submission_id, reviewer_id, decision, comments, created_at. Relationship: one Submission can have multiple Feedback entries. `n Grades Records evaluation results from Examiners. Attributes: grade_id, project_id, examiner_id, score, comments, submitted_at. Relationship: one Project can have multiple Grades from different Examiners. `n E) Scheduling and Defense `n Schedules Defines deadlines and events (global or project-specific). Attributes: schedule_id, project_id, event_type, due_at, venue, created_by, created_at. Relationship: Schedules are set by Coordinators and may apply globally (null project_id) or per project. `n ExaminerAssignments Links Examiners to Projects. Attributes: assignment_id, project_id, examiner_id, assigned_at. `n Defenses Represents defense events scheduled by Coordinators. Attributes: defense_id, project_id, scheduled_at, venue, created_by, created_at. Relationship: each Project may have one or more Defenses. `n F) Automation, Extensions, and Audit `n Notifications Automated messages/reminders for deadlines, feedback, or defense events. Attributes: notification_id, user_id, subject, message, status, created_at, sent_at. `n ExtensionRequests Manages cases where Researchers request extra time. Attributes: extension_id, researcher_id, submission_type, reason, requested_deadline, status, decision_date. `n AuditLogs Records system actions for accountability. Attributes: log_id, user_id, action, entity, entity_id, details, created_at. `n 4.3 Relationships (Cardinalities) `n One Role can be assigned to many Users (1:N). `n One User extends into exactly one Actor Profile (Researcher, Advisor, Coordinator, Examiner) (1:1). `n One Researcher can have one or more ResearchProjects (1:N). `n One Advisor supervises multiple ResearchProjects, but cannot exceed 10 active researchers (1:N, capacity rule). `n One ResearchProject requires one Researcher and one Advisor, and may have multiple Submissions (1:N). `n Each Submission must use one DocumentTemplate (N:1). `n Each Submission can receive multiple Feedback entries (1:N). `n Each ResearchProject may receive multiple Grades from different Examiners (1:N). `n Each ResearchProject can have multiple Schedules (1:N) and multiple Defenses (1:N). `n Each ResearchProject can be linked to multiple Examiners via ExaminerAssignments (N:M). `n Each Notification belongs to one User (N:1). `n Each ExtensionRequest belongs to one Researcher (N:1). `n Each AuditLog records an action performed by one User (N:1). `n 4.4 Business Rules `n Advisor Capacity: An advisor supervises no more than 10 active researchers. `n Advisor Requirement for Proposal: A researcher must have an assigned advisor before submitting a proposal. `n Submission Windows: Submissions are only accepted within scheduled deadlines. `n Formatting and Plagiarism: Thesis submissions must pass format and plagiarism checks before approval. `n Defense Scheduling: Defense must be scheduled at least 10 days after examiner assignment. `n Unique User Accounts: Each researcher may only hold one system account. `n 4.5 Performance Considerations `n Unique index on users.email for authentication. `n Composite index on (project_id, type, status) in Submissions to accelerate dashboards. `n Index on (advisor_id) in ResearchProjects to support advisor capacity checks. `n Index on (user_id, status) in Notifications for reminder processing. `n Append-only design of AuditLogs supports compliance and reporting. `n 4.6 ER Diagram `n The Entityâ€“Relationship Diagram (ERD) derived from this schema depicts all entities, attributes, and cardinalities. It demonstrates how user roles, actor profiles, projects, submissions, reviews, grades, schedules, defenses, notifications, extension requests, and audit logs interact to support the research lifecycle. `n  `n  `n  `n  `n  `n  `n  `n  `n  `n  `n  `n  `n  `n  `n  `n  `n  `n  `n  `n  `n  `n  `n  `n  `n  `n  `n  `n  `n  `n  `n  `n  `n  `n  `n  `n  `n  `n  `n  `n  `n
