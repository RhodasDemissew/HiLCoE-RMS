It plays a vital role in academic and professional environments, driving innovation, critical thinking, and informed decision-making.                In today's research-driven academic environments, institutions and researchers are faced with increasingly complex challenges in managing the entire      life-cycle      of research activities. From proposal development to final submission and validation, the research process involves multiple stakeholders, strict quality standards, and a growing need for transparency, traceability, and digital support. As academic institutions strive to maintain integrity and foster innovation, traditional paper-based or semi-digital systems often fall short in delivering efficiency, accountability, and adaptability.           The     Research Management System (RMS)     d    igital platform or software tool used to oversee and streamline all activities related to academic or institutional research. It supports the entire research      life-cycle      from proposal to publication    .           The main characteristics (or features) of a Research Management System (RMS) revolve around effectively managing the entire research      life-cycle      from proposal to final publication.                       Life-cycle          Support         :               Supports every stage of research: proposal, review, approval, execution, submission, and publication.                       User Role Management         :               Different users (students, supervisors, reviewers, admins) have different permissions and dashboards.                       Proposal Management       :        Allows submission, editing, and version tracking of research proposals.                       Document Management         :               Securely stores all research files       :         proposals, ethics forms, drafts, and final papers.                       Progress Monitoring         :               Tracks research status, timelines, and milestone completion       .                        Communication Tools         :               Built-in chat, messaging, or comment sections for collaboration between supervisors and students.                       Plagiarism &amp;          AI          Verification         :               Integrates tools to check for originality or uses AI/NLP to verify content quality.                       Security and Access Control         :               Protects sensitive research data using role-based access and data encryption.                       Reporting &amp; Analytics         :               Generates reports on research status, supervisor activity, number of approved proposals, etc.                       Funding and Budget         :               Manages research grants, budgets, and fund usage (if applicable).                       Publication and Archiving         :               Supports research publication submission and archiving of completed projects.                The HiLCoE Research Management System (HiLCoE-RMS) addresses this gap by introducing a centralized digital platform designed to manage and streamline every stage of the research lifecycle. Unlike existing fragmented solutions, HiLCoE-RMS is tailored to the specific workflows of         HiLCoEâ€™s         academic structure. It integrates modern technologies               such as web-based architecture, role-based access control, and Natural Language Processing (NLP)               to enable real-time tracking, verification, and collaboration.                The platform enables supervisors to monitor student progress, ensures researchers receive timely feedback, and provides institutional administrators with tools to enforce compliance and evaluate academic quality. More importantly, HiLCoE-RMS incorporates intelligent verification features powered by AI/NLP, which assist in detecting academic inconsistencies and support research originality, thereby reinforcing academic integrity.                Through this system, the institution not only digitizes operations but also transforms the way research is conducted, reviewed, and managed. By offering features such as research idea tracking, profile-based researcher identification, automated paper verification, and internal messaging tools, HiLCoE-RMS fosters a culture of structured, transparent, and data-driven academic research.                 Ultimately, this project envisions a scalable and extensible system that can evolve with future educational needsâ€”supporting not just digital transformation, but also enhancing the quality, credibility, and efficiency of academic research at HiLCoE.           The             HiLCoE-RMS             research          life-cycle      typically follows these key stages:                   Topic Identification &amp; Proposal Development     â€“ Researchers define their area of study and submit a research proposal.     â€“        HiLCoE-RMS             supports this through structured proposal submission and review workflows        .                   Literature Review &amp; Methodology Design     â€“ Investigating existing works and designing how the research will be conducted.       â€“    The         system offers tools for documenting literature references and uploading methodology drafts        .                   Data Collection &amp; Analysis     â€“ Researchers gather data, apply methods, and generate results.       â€“             HiLCoE-RMS             enables progress tracking and supervisor feedback during these stages.                   Drafting &amp; Submitting Research Papers     â€“ Final papers are compiled, formatted, and submitted for evaluation.       â€“    The platform provides submission interfaces, document version, and deadline tracking.                   Verification &amp; Plagiarism Check     â€“ Institutions assess originality and compliance with academic standards.       â€“             HiLCoE-RMS             integrates AI/NLP-based verification to automate academic integrity checks.                   Review, Feedback, and Final Approval     â€“ Supervisors and admins give final feedback and decide on acceptance.       â€“         Built-in feedback channels and admin dashboards streamline this communication.                   Archiving &amp; Publication     â€“ Approved works are stored and possibly published.        â€“         The system archives research projects, tagging them by author and topic for future access.                  2. Problem Statement                 Despite the growing emphasis on academic research excellence, many higher education institutions still face significant administrative and operational barriers in managing research activities. Research processes often involve multiple stakeholdersâ€”students, supervisors, administrators               and require constant coordination, evaluation, and documentation. However, the lack of a centralized, intelligent platform to manage these activities introduces serious challenges that affect efficiency, transparency, and quality.                The core problems include:        - Fragmented Research Lifecycle        - Lack of Researcher Traceability        - Manual Verification Processes        - Poor Communication Channels        - Compliance and Standards Enforcement                These challenges contribute to administrative inefficiencies, reduced research quality, and a frustrating experience for both students and academic staff. There is a clear need for a comprehensive Research Management System that not only digitizes research workflows but also empowers institutions with intelligent tools for verification, traceability, and structured collaboration.                  3.

Project Schedule                 The 10-week project schedule balances core development with testing, AI integration, and stakeholder feedback. Tasks are sequenced logically, and the Gantt chart illustrates dependencies.                 Week Highlights:        - Weeks 1â€“2: Requirements and Design        - Weeks 3â€“5: Core Development        - Weeks 6â€“7: AI/NLP Integration        - Weeks 8â€“9: Testing &amp; Debugging        - Week 10: Deployment and Optional Features                                                                                                               9.
